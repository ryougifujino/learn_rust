// The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter thatâ€™s a
// reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter:
// fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32); a function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters:
// fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32); and so on.
//
// The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is
// assigned to all output lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
//
// The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is
// &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output
// lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer
// symbols are necessary.
